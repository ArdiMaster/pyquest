# pyGame
Currently, there's not much here, but I hope to turn this into a Python-based interpreter for interactive fiction games created in [Quest](https://textadventures.co.uk/Quest).

### Why Python?
It is (relatively) easy to use, comes with an extensive standard library, and is relatively widely used (so the chances that a user might already have it installed are not all that slim). Plus, it's what we (have to) use in University, so we're somewhat used to it.

### Dependencies
Requires Python 3.6. May in the future require pygame and js2py.
